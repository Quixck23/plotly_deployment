# Plotly deployment

## Project Overview

Many bacteria species are not well studied, and many more remain unknown to science. Our role is to discover and document these bacteria. We are focused on bacterial species that can synthesize proteins that taste like beef. We have vast amounts of data from many volunteers in which we have collected and visualized the data in this well-analyzed dashboard.
